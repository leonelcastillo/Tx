# Project suggestions

Ideas and suggestions to improve the plastic bottle transactions project:

- Data validation: add stricter validation for phone numbers and wallet addresses.
- Authentication: require operators to authenticate (API key or user accounts).
- Exports: add CSV/Excel export for records and simple reports (total kg per day, per person).
- Mobile-friendly UI: add a small React or mobile web form for field entry.
- Offline-first: allow collecting data offline and syncing later.
- Audit/logs: track who edited or cancelled transactions and why.
- Pricing/payment: if you pay contributors, add payout tracking and statuses.
- Integrations: connect wallets for crypto payments or SMS for donor notification.

Small next steps:

1. Add unit tests for CRUD operations.
2. Add Alembic migrations if schema will change.
3. Deploy to a small VPS or a serverless platform if you need remote access.

Contact & notes:

- If you'd like, I can add a simple React form or a tiny Electron wrapper so collectors can use a desktop/mobile app.
- I can also add Alembic migrations and unit tests next.
